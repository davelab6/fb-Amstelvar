# Amstelvar

### About the Design

Amstelvar is a typeface inspired by the typeface designs used in The Netherlands and Belgium from the sixteenth century to the development of Times Roman in the 1930s.

It was the first public demonstration of the Type Network "Parametric Axes" approach to the OpenType Variable Fonts technology.

The font is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](OFL.txt), which permits unrestricted usage, distribution, and modification, subject to terms in the license. 

### Specification

The first release of "Amstelvar Alpha" was in early 2017. 
In 2018 theÂ project scope expanded to a "1.0"-level release with a Roman redrawn for highest quality, a new Italic, and wider language support with the [Google Latin Plus](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets) glyph set (around 600 total: 567 main glyphs + 25 optional + build glyphs).

The variable axis work includes:

1. Reform registered axes (wght, wdth) to idealize them for the default optical size (14 pt)
2. Extend the registered axes for a full range of opsz (8 to 144 pt)
3. Create other blended axis (GRAD)
4. Create the "primary parametric" axes (XTRA,  XOPQ, YOPQ), limited to minor adjustments
5. Create the "Y Transparency bundle" of alignments (YTLC, YTUC, YTFG, YTAS, YTDE, and then YTRA)
6. Create (and define as needed) all the "secondary parametric" axes

#### Axes

* Y Tranparency Bundle: YTLC, YTUC, YTFG, YTAS, YTDE
* Secondary parametric axes: YTOS, YTUS, YTAD, YTDD, XTAB, YTSE, VUID, VOTF, YTCH, XTCH, POPS, PWTH, PWHT, UDLN

Within `Amstelvar/Docs` there is a [AMSTELVAR DESIGNSPACE MAP2.pdf](https://github.com/TypeNetwork/Amstelvar/blob/master/docs/AMSTELVAR%20DESIGNSPACE%20MAP%202.pdf) file with notes on overall design space, and progress display on contols milestone.

[Amstelvar Artboard 2.pdf](https://github.com/TypeNetwork/Amstelvar/blob/master/docs/Amstelvar%20Artboard%202.pdf) shows entire complete glyphs, link to measurement and glyphs [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZ6nu8wDf1q3_F4Rabbn0bBvpqG41On4LcoBH0Y8EEI) that contains measured values and other data forvariable font creation.
